### Digital Signal Processing

From my growing interest in how devices communicate wirelessly, I stumbled on DSP. Not a surprise I guess. Well, it all balled down to the understanding of the 
mathematical and computational toolbox that allowed us to manipulate and extract information from signals: seeing that most of our modern runs on signals.
