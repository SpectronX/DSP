### Digital Signal Processing

My growing interest in how devices communicate wirelessly, led me to DSP. Not a surprise I guess. Well, it all balled down to the understanding of the 
mathematical and computational toolbox that allowed us to manipulate and extract information from signals: seeing that most of our modern world runs on signals.

In 'The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to DSP', Steven W. Smith simply defines DSP as "the mathematics, the algorithms, and the techniques used to manipulate
signals after they have been converted into a digital form"

This self-study journey has been an interesting one, and here I would be sharing some exciting stuff and information I come across. 
I didn't realize the amount of math I was getting myself into. Well, now there's no escape 😅. 

Let's dive in.
